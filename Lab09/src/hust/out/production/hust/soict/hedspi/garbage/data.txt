If you’re interested in how to build an Agile team, this article is perfect for you.

Creating good software apps helps your company to maintain and thrive. A well-controlled process is the only way to guarantee a good product.

The agile team will help you develop an app effectively. But first, what is Agile?

What is Agile?

Agile is a flexible software development method and project management that delivers products to users the fastest with minimal problems. Instead of risking on a one-time product release after everything is done, the Agile team will release one piece at a time but are guaranteed to be usable. All the requirements, plans, and outcomes are evaluated continuously so the development team can change quickly to suit reality.

How did Agile get started?
Before the 1990s of the 20th century, there was a crisis in software development methodology globally. This crisis was many weaknesses in the traditional methods and a high rate of project failure. Many individuals and private companies have self-discovered and developed many methods to adjust to new situations, where the business environment’s factors and technology change rapidly, causing traditional development methods to be no longer suitable. These individual methods partly solve some problems but create other problems of sharing, collaboration, techniques, tools, extensions, development directions, etc.
That’s why, in February 2001, seventeen developers who represented the new development method met in Utah to establish the document called Agile Manifesto with 12 principles thanks to consensus in methods. This was the time the Agile terminology used widely nowadays. Even individual methods have existed before.

Roles in the Agile Method
User: Clear target audience begins the process. By defining the exact users’ characteristics, those functions help build all the multiple standards/requirements in the workflow that software supports.

Product Owner: Are the main stakeholders or the main users of the soon-to-be-developed app. A product owner is a representative of the customers and the final authority. They’re always ready when anyone has any doubts that need clarification. The most important thing that the Product Owner needs to understand is no requirement addition between the sprint phase or the beginning of the sprint.

Software development team: In Agile, programmers are involved in developing specific functions. They can have different skills, and some even are good at certain skills.

Moreover, the Software development team includes quality assurance engineers (QA) and other programmers (such as databases and backend systems), designers, and analysts, which depends on the type of project.

Agile Methods (Agile Frameworks)

Scrum
The most common and widely used Agile Framework is Scrum, a management and control process applied in software development projects. It helps eliminate all the workflow’s complexity and focuses only on the necessary steps to meet the customers’ needs. Scrum can be considered a Framework or a set of practices for being applied in software development.

Scrum was established in the 90s and currently is considered an effective Framework and used widely between many small and big companies. Scrum’s feature is simple and easy to apply.

Scrum incorporates a distribution rhythm called a Sprint (a repeating phrase of a Scrum). Sprints last from a week to a month and continue to keep projects progressing as fast as possible. Four key events happen in each sprint.

Makes plans to determine the sprint priorities.
Daily Scrum Calls/Meetings – Development Team has a meeting for 15 minutes/day to track the team's progress against the sprint goals and identify blockers.
Sprint Review - Development Team collaborates and exchanges opinions/views on completed tasks and adjusts backlog as required.
Sprint Retrospective - This is a great learning experience for the Development Team. The group discusses openly key items that have been successful and cases where the group fails to meet expectations to improve things for the future.
